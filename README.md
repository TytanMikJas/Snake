# Snake Game üêç


## Description

This Snake game was created as a project for the "Jƒôzyki Skryptowe" course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The objective of the project was to create some working app in a very very short period of time, as I had important exams and Hackaton comming up. :)

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay where the player controls a snake to eat food, rocks and stras to grow longer.
- Responsive controls using the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- Random generation of food, rocks, start to keep the game interesting and challenging.
- Sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
- A LeaderBoard feature if anyone wanted to get more competetive :)

## How to Play

1. Install Python and Pygame:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
   - Install the Pygame and Pygame_gui library by running `pip install pygame`, `pip install pygame_gui` in the terminal.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the repository's directory and run the `main.py` script using Python:
   python main.py
   
4. Press PLAY and input your nickname to start the game.

5. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
   You can also press "P" for pause or "Esc" to quit the current session and to enter as a different player.

6. Guide the snake to eat the apples and stars to grow longer!

8. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body and do not eat rocks!!!

9. The game will automatically restart when the snake collides with the walls or itself or in case it shirnks too much.
